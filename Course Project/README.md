# Non-simultaneous gravitationl interaction

This project aims to explore and visualize the different behaviors of bodies moving in a gravitational field, 
based on the assumption of whether the interaction signals between them propagate at a finite speed or not.
In classical mechanics, interactions between bodies are assumed to be instantaneous, i.e., without accounting 
for the time interval needed for the signal to travel the distance between them. However, modern physics asserts 
that signals and interactions cannot propagate instantaneouslyâ€”the maximum speed of propagation is the speed of light. 
This leads to some interesting consequences for the trajectories of orbits."
